This program implements a Ruby class which models a checkers board. 

The class has methods which allow a caller to ask whether a proposed
move is valid or not and then to actually make a move.

It only handle regular moves, not captures, and it doesn't handle
kinging or moves by kinged pieces.

It doesn't handle real user interaction or choose good moves.
