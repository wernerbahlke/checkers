This program implements a Ruby class which models a checkers board. 

The class has methods which allow a caller to ask whether a proposed
move is valid or not and then to actually make a move.

It only handle regular moves, not captures, and it doesn't handle
kinging or moves by kinged pieces.

It doesn't handle real user interaction or choose good moves.

IMPLEMENTATION:

The board represents only the 32 fields (8 rows of 4) where checkers pieces can be placed.
Indexing within the board and coordinates go from 1 to 32 (therefore the array @board's size is 33).
For a display version of the game we have to do a coordinate transformation to a full 8 by 8 board.
